"""
THE ELIGIBILITY DATABASE IN DEVELOPMENT (2026-10-15; DSN name and migrations 2026-10-28).

ELIGIBILITY_DSN (or the older DATABASE_URL) in a developer's .env may name a local PostgreSQL by PORT -- and the
embedded development server comes back on a NEW port after every reboot (59675 -> 61989 ...), so the eligibility
screen read nothing ("data source unavailable") although the server was running. At startup, ONLY when ENVIRONMENT is
a development one:
    the DSN is reachable    its schema is brought up to date (migrations.py); NO demo rows are added -- a real
                            database (pgAdmin) gets demo data only on request (scripts/setup_agent_databases.py)
    it is not reachable     the app's own embedded development PostgreSQL (shared.store, runtime/pgdata) is used: its
                            `eligibility` database is created when missing, migrated, the synthetic demo cases loaded
                            (demo_seed.sql, is_demo = true), and ELIGIBILITY_DSN set for this process.
Never in production: a deployment names its database and a wrong one is an error, never silently replaced.
